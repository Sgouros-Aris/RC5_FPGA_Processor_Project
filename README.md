# RC5_FPGA_Processor_Project
This is a project I did for class in Fall 2017. The project involved writing VHDL code to emulate a single-stage, MIPS-like processor on the Nexys4DDR FPGA board. I then wrote assembly code for the processor to implement the RC5 cryptographic algorithm. Video demonstration of the project running on the FPGA can be found at https://youtu.be/zVQs-y0smLg.
